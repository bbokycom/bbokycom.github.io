        <h2>Part 1: Selfie - The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way</h2>
        <div class="comparison">
            <img src="IMG_3794.JPG" alt="Selfie - The Wrong Way" style="width:45%; margin-right:2%;">
            <img src="IMG_3795.JPG" alt="Selfie - The Right Way" style="width:45%;">
        </div>
         The left image is taken too close to my face, causing distortion and an uncomfortable perspective. The right image is taken at a greater distance, which looks more natural and what you would expect to see in real life.

        <h2>Part 2: Architectural Perspective Compression</h2>
        <div class="comparison">
            <img src="IMG_3789.JPG" alt="Wide Angle - Perspective Distortion" style="width:45%; margin-right:2%;">
            <img src="IMG_3793.JPG" alt="Telephoto - Perspective Compression" style="width:45%;">
        </div>
         The left image is taken from far away and zoomed in, resulting in a compressed perspective where the Hearst Memorial Mining Building appears closer to the fountain, while the right image is taken from a closer distance with a wide-angle lens, making the building appear farther away from the fountain.
